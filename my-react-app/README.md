# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


## Answers 
1) What is NPM & package.json?

NPM (Node Package Manager) is a tool that helps JavaScript developers install, manage, and update libraries or frameworks they want to use in their projects. Instead of manually downloading files, NPM automates it by saving time and making sure everything stays organized.

Inside every modern JavaScript project, there is a file called package.json. This file keeps a record of the project’s details eg like its name, version, scripts, and all the dependencies the project relies on. It basically acts as the project’s “manifest,” telling NPM what needs to be installed and how the app should run   

2)What is Vite?

Vite is a modern build tool for front-end development. It makes creating React, Vue, or vanilla JavaScript apps faster and more efficient. Unlike older tools that take time to bundle files before running, Vite starts a development server instantly and updates the browser instantly when you save changes.
Vite improves the developer experience by speeding up setup, hot reloading, and build time — which makes working on projects smoother and more enjoyable.
