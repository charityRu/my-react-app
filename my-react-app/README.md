# CourseHub – Online Learning Platform & React Summary 

This project is a responsive landing page built using **ReactJS** and **CSS Modules**, based on a provided Figma design.

The goal of the project was to replicate the UI layout as closely as possible while using reusable components and clean styling.

## 👩🏽‍💻 Developer
**Charity R. Mapfudza**  


## 🔧 Technologies Used
- ReactJS (Vite)
- CSS Modules
- HTML5
- Git & GitHub

## 📁 Project Structure
The project is structured using separate components for each section of the landing page, including:
- Navbar
- Hero
- Categories
- Courses
- About / Why Choose Us
- Testimonials
- Instructors
- Blog
- Newsletter
- Footer

This approach makes the code easier to read, maintain, and scale.

## 🎯 Project Objective
To demonstrate understanding of:
- React components
- Component-based layout
- CSS Modules for scoped styling
- Translating a Figma UI design into a working web application

## 🚀 Deployment
This project will be deployed using a hosting platform **Vercel** .

📘 React & JavaScript Learning Summary
1. Introduction to React

React is a JavaScript library that is used to build user interfaces, especially for modern web applications. Instead of writing everything in one large HTML file, React allows developers to break the interface into smaller parts called components. Each component handles a specific part of the page, which makes the code easier to understand and manage.

React uses JSX, which looks like HTML but is written inside JavaScript. This makes it easier to design the UI while still using JavaScript logic. One important concept in React is props, which allow data to be passed from one component to another. Another key idea is state, which helps a component remember and update information when something changes.

React also uses a virtual DOM, which improves performance by updating only the parts of the page that change instead of reloading everything.

2. React Hooks

React Hooks are special functions that allow function components to use features that were previously only available in class components. Hooks make the code simpler and easier to read.

The most commonly used hooks include:

useState – used to store and update values in a component.

useEffect – used to run code when a component loads or when certain data changes.

useRef – used to access elements directly.

useContext – used to share data between components without passing props through every level.

Hooks help make React applications more interactive and reduce the amount of repetitive code.

3. JavaScript HTML DOM – Document

The Document Object Model (DOM) represents the structure of a web page. When a page loads, the browser creates a DOM that JavaScript can interact with. The document object is the main entry point used to access and control elements on the page.

Using the document object, developers can:

Find elements on the page

Create new elements

Modify content and styles

Remove elements when needed

This allows JavaScript to make web pages dynamic instead of static.

4. JavaScript HTML DOM – Elements

DOM elements represent individual parts of a webpage such as buttons, paragraphs, and images. Once an element is selected, JavaScript can change its text, style, attributes, or behavior.

For example, JavaScript can:

Change text when a button is clicked

Update styles dynamically

Add or remove elements

Respond to user actions using events

This is what makes websites interactive and responsive to user input.

5. Conclusion

From these resources, I learned how JavaScript controls web pages using the DOM and how React simplifies UI development by managing updates automatically. Instead of manually manipulating the DOM, React provides a cleaner and more efficient way to build large applications using components and hooks.
